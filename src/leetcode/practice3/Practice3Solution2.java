/*
 * The above solution requires at most 2n steps. In fact, it could be optimized to require only n
 * steps. Instead of using a set to tell if a character exists or not, we could define a mapping of
 * the characters to its index. Then we can skip the characters immediately when we found a repeated
 * character. The reason is that if s[j]s[j] have a duplicate in the range [i, j)[i,j) with index j'
 * , we don't need to increase ii little by little. We can skip all the elements in the range [i,
 * j'] and let ii to be j' + 1 directly.
